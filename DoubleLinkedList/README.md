# Implement a Doubly Linked List in C

Implement a  doubly linked list data structure in C, supporting the following operations:

1. Insertion:
-  Insert a new node at the beginning of the list.
-  Insert a new node at the end of the list.
-  Insert a new node after a specific node.
2. Deletion:
- Delete the first node from the list.
- Delete the last node from the list.
- Delete a specific node from the list.
3. Manipulation:
- Swap two nodes by value or by pointer.
- Sort the list using bubble sort and selection sort algorithms.
4. Search:
- Search for a specific value in a sorted or unsorted list.
5. Modification:
- Remove duplicate nodes from the list.
- Merge two sorted lists alternately.
6. Error Handling:
- Detect and remove any loops present in the list.
